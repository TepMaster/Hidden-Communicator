                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <h2>What is Tor?</h2>
                <p>Tor—short for the Onion Routing project—is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users' online privacy is protected. Tor users' digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion
                    .</p>
                <p>We aim to provide usability and security at the same time.</p>

                <h2>Are there any fees on Hidden Communicator?</h2>
                <p>We dont charge any fees the service is free.</p>

                <h2>Is Hidden Communicator easier than the standard GPG client?</h2>

                <p>Hidden Communicator is as simple and easy as possible, we have a very minimalistic interface which should be easy to understand for most people.</p>

                <h2>Is it more secure than the standard GPG client?</h2>
                <p>
                    With the standard GPG client you will need alot of knowledge about how to protect your keys.dat file, which is basically impossible for most normal people who dont run multiple PCs, virtualization
                    software, encryption tools etc.
                </p>
                <p>Also if you don't do regular backups on the standard client, there is a high risk of loosing your kes.</p>
                <p>On Hidden GPG-COM we take care of all that, protecting your kes while all you have to do is keep your password in a safe place.</p>

                <h2>What happens if i lose my password?</h2>
                <p>Don't lose your password! We dont have password recovery functions for security reasons. (Most accounts get hacked these days using weak password recovery functions)</p>
                <p>We recommend you write down your password on a piece of paper and store it securely.</p>

                <h2>Can i get a new account?</h2>
                <p>To keep it simple you are free to open as many accounts as you wish!</p>
